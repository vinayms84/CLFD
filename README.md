The CLFD framework code has two components: label corrector and fraud detector. 
The label corrector is responsible for cleaning the noisy labels and provides corrected labels for each session and the code for this component is available in the folder Label_Corrector. The label corrector is trained in two stages: self-supervised pre-training and then classifier training. First perform self-supervised pre-training by running the file self_supervised_pre_train.py and then perform classifier training by running the file classifier_train.py. After training, the model will be saved in the same folder. Copy the saved model in the folder Fraud_Detector. 
The fraud detector employs the corrected labels obtained from the label corrector and trains the session encoder by using supervised contrastive learning. The code for this component is available in the folder Fraud_Detector. The fraud detector is trained in two stages: supervised pre-training  and then classifier training. First perform supervised pre-training by running the file supervised_pre_train.py and then perform classifier training by running the file classifier_train.py. After training, the new model will be saved in the same folder.
The Test folder has the file: test.py. Use this file for the test case inference. Before running this file, copy paste the saved model files from the Fraud_Detector folder into the Test folder.
